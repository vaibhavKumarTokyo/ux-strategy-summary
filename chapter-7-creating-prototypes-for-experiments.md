## Test Minimum Viable Product

### Principle:

* Run experiment **as soon as possible**
* Use **less money**--Concierge 
* **Continuous** testing
* Giving it your **best shot**
* Start **small**
* Be a **Go-getter**
* Stay in a **partnership**
* **Test by yourself** or within group members \(Like Jaime sell her skill on TradeYa\)

#### Experiment: Test of Hypothesis

Test the hypothesis based on measurable results---Reject or accept your original hypothesis

### Inspiration after reading Lean Startup

* Plan for making small incremental pre-releases that articulated different aspects of UX
* Collaborate and Strategize with your team members to ensure a quick release
* Continual test UX and value proposition
* Shrink your product \(Eg, 5 steps to 3 steps; User can use a service without signing up;\)

### How to Experiment:

* Online Campaign: Increase and track conversion rate
  * * Convert click to like to customers 
    * Example: Dropbox screencase
* Concierge MVP \(No interface backend-Save Resources to build\)
* * * Manually simulate a complex digital product--An attempt to simulate an aspect of the customers experience without the interface and to do it with as little friction as possible
