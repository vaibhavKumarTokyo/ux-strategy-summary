# Chapter 7: Creating Prototypes for Experiments

## Test Minimum Viable Product

> The premature outlay of huge amounts of money in pursuit of the wrong strategy is the thing to avoid. You need to have an experiemental mindset. --Clayton Christensen

### Principle:

* Run experiment **as soon as possible**
* Use **less money**--Concierge 
* **Continuous** testing
* Giving it your **best shot**
* Start **small**
* Be a **Go-getter**
* Stay in a **partnership**
* **Test by yourself** or within group members \(Like Jaime sell her skill on TradeYa\)

### Purpose

Deliver a solution that people Really Really want

### Running Experiment to match solution to solve customers problem

Understand your customers' problems and tweaking the solution to the csutomers' needs.

> In a great market-a market with lots of real potential customers-the market pulls product out of the start-up. ---Marc Anderson

Experiment: Test of Hypothesis

Test the hypothesis based on measurable results---Reject or accept your original hypothesis

### Inspiration after Lean Startup

* Plan for making **small** incremental pre-releases that articulated different aspects of UX
* **Collaborate** and Strategize with your team members to ensure a quick release
* **Continual** test UX and value proposition
* **Shrink** your product \(Eg, 5 steps to 3 steps; User can use a service without signing up; etc\)

### How to Experiment:

* **Online Campaign:** Increase and track conversion rate
  * Goal: Measure if potential customers take action
  * Convert click to like to customers 
  * Example: Dropbox screencase
* **Concierge MVP** \(No interface backend-Save Resources to build\)
  * Manually simulate a complex digital product--An attempt to simulate an aspect of the customers experience without the interface and to do it with as little friction as possible
  * For example: Jared manually facilitate the trade by email or coordinate time for them to meet up---Help both parties with the swap logistics

> ### OZ Paradigm
>
> Create simulations of new technologies to test out innovative concepts \(to the users who have little knowledge of computer\) is core to gaining early validation

## Test Product/Market Fit by using Prototypes

#### Goal of prototype: 

avoid coding and designing until you have true validation that your solution is desired and can be sustained by your hypothetical customer segment.

#### Types of prototype:

Low-fidelity paper prototype

High-fidelity prototype

#### How

Use your storyboard as the starting point for creating a solution prototype 

Note: Make sure it ie easy to use and understand for users, no imaginations

#### 3 Steps to design having the solution prototype

**Purpose:**

Force yout team to create the **minimum amount of screens** necessary to demonstrate the **key experience** of the interface, the **value proposition**, and a sneak peak of the **potential business model** of the product.

**How:** Copy the interface and artwork from other websites and type set the content

#### What does the solution prototype include

1. Setup
2. Key UX 1 \(1-3 screens\) :shows the crucial interations that show value innovation
3. Key UX 2 \(1-3 screens\): shows the cruicial interations that show value innovation
4. Pricing strategy: shows the cose of the app, monthly fees, package costs and so on

#### Step 1

Outline of screens that include one or two key experiences.

-----Does the product solve the customer's problem?

Example:

* Landing page with the user's query entered
* Result set withe listing and the maps and the filters exposed
* Filtered result set with the listing and the maps and the filters closed
* Result detailed screen
* Photo gallery featuring images of a home, specific to the wedding
* Package options with pricing
* Tour setup screen
* Confirmation screen with final pricing, including cost of service

#### Step 2 

Start mashing up the images that tell the story

Make it seem real

How:

Borrow images from your competitors and influencers

Example: Page 162~

#### Step 3 

Paste all the screenshots into the presentation tool

Use Google Presentations 

* Easy simultaneous collaboration
* Displays a narrative  linearity of the key experience
* Show it to customers in a easy-to-understand way \(PDF\)

### Solution prototype reality check

Ask questions regarding the prototype's **Feasibility** and S**ustainability**

Is it easy to scale?

How to get the initial inventory?

Photography quality

## **Recap**

* Do not burn time or money or efforts on a product no one may want to use.
* Concierge the experience of a new product
* Most experiments fail
* Collaborate and discuss after experiment
