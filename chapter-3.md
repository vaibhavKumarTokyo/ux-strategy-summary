# Chapter 3: Validating the Value Proposition

Most startups fail because the market doesn't necessarily need the product.

> You need to ground your team in reality with empirical evidence. You must turn assumptions into fact.

## **What is Value Proposition?**

> “This” for “that”.

This is the magical power of the product.  ****That is the specific customer segment and their need.

## **Five Steps to reach Product/Solution Fit**

### **Step 1: Define your primary customer segment**

_The customer is a group of segment of people with a common need or pain._

> Describe in 10 words or fewer a set of people whom you can zero-in.

### **Step 2: Identify your customer segment’s biggest problem**

Make assumptions about your users, their needs, and how to solve them.

> And acknowledge that you are working on assumptions.

Write out the customer and problem hypothesis.

Don’t build your product’s UX around a value proposition unless you have tangible evidence that people will want the product.

> find common `job-to-be-done`

### **Step 3: Create provisional personas based on your assumptions**

A provisional personal will be helpful communication tool to depict your hypothesized customer and align your team.

**Name and snapshot/sketch**

**Description**

The description should be a composite archetype of the customer that is relevant to the product idea.

**Behaviors**

How is the customer trying to solve the problem? How does the persona’s personality affect his behavior?

**Needs and goals**

What motivates the customer and causes her to act a certain way. What is missing from the current solution? What specific needs or goals aren’t being satisfied by the customer’s current behavior?

### **Step 4: Conduct customer delivery to validate or invalidate your solution’s initial value proposition**

Customer discovery is a process used to discover, test, and validate whether a specific product solves a known problem for an identifiable group of users.

You must get out of the building and get customer validation, which is foundational to the _Lean Startup business_ approach.

**The Problem Interview**

You need to identify two or three nearby locations where you can make direct contact with your proposed customers.

The problem interview is made up of two parts: the screener and the interview.

**Phase 1: The screener questions**

Questions to weed out the wrong people.

**Phase 2: The interview**

Context questions set up the context for your solution.

`Money-shot questions` validate or invalidate your hypothetical value proposition.  


### **Step 5: Reassess your value proposition based on what you learned \(And continue to iterate until you have product/market fit\)**

## **Recap**

Value propositions of products evolve with a great understanding of customers’ needs.
