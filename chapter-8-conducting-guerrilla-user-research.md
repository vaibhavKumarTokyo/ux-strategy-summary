# Chapter 8: Conducting Guerrilla User Research

## Type of User Research

### **Usability testing** 

* Usability testing focuses on whether your products work by discovering how people use the product in real time. 
* Data points tested in a usability study include the following: 
  * Does the user perform the required tasks using the interface? 
  * How many clicks does it take for users to perform them? 
  * How long does it take for the user to figure out your product?
* Online tool: [https://www.usertesting.com/](https://www.usertesting.com/)

### **Ethnographic research**

the study of people in their natural environment

* how their current solution is being used in their environment
* discovering relationships with other objects/people and any hidden factors oblivious otherwise 

## Why Guerrilla User Research?

For clients with little time or no budgets, traditional user research such as ethnographic studies would take too much time, and usability testing just isn’t relevant to help determine if your value proposition is on target or your key user experiences provide value innovation. 

## What is Guerrilla User Research?

It’s cost-effective and the mobile tactics should help you to validate the following quickly: 

* Are you targeting the correct customer segment? 
* Are you solving a common pain point the customer has? 
* Is the solution you are proposing \(demonstrated in the prototype of key experiences\) something they would seriously consider using? 
* Would they pay for the product, and, if not, what are the other potential revenue models?
* Does the business model work?

## The Three Main Phases of Guerrilla User Research

### Planning phase 

> **Duration:** one to two weeks \(depending on team size and number of participants\)

* Determining the objectives of the research study. 

  Define which aspects of the value proposition and UX are being examined. 

{% hint style="info" %}
“What is the most important thing I need to learn to determine if this product really has any purpose, marketability, and viability?”   
What this means is that you need to ask what is the riskiest assumption\(s\) still on the table at this point in your process.
{% endhint %}

* Preparing the questions to be asked that will get us validating.  Then, rehearse the entire interview along with giving the prototype demonstration.

{% hint style="info" %}
create your interview around two great approaches: the problem interview, and the solution interview, from _Running Lean_
{% endhint %}

* Scouting out the venue\(s\) and mapping out logistics. 
* Advertising for participants. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Popular ways for finding participants: _craiglist, meetup, facebook friends, linkedIn, local university etc._

* Screening the participants and scheduling time slots.

### Interview phase 

> **Duration:** one day

* Prepping the venue Participant payments, café etiquette, and tipping 
* Conducting the interviews 
* Taking succinct notes

{% hint style="info" %}
At the conclusion of the interview, be sure to thank the participants by name. Share with them a tidbit of the knowledge you gained from the screener interviews to make it personal, and tell them how much you value their honest feedback. Ask if they might be open for you to follow up with them in the future when you are further along with the product.
{% endhint %}

### Analysis phase 

> **Duration:** two to four hours

* Objective is to extract "_Validated Learning_" from interviews
* Can make following assessments
  * Assess to determine if the correct customer segment was reached
  * Assess if the problem that your product is trying to solve is an actual problem.
    * Is it a big problem or small problem?
  * Assess if the solution that you showed was on target.
    * _Were participants excited about solution?_

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the value proposition was not validated, assess why immediately?  
_Was it because you had the wrong customer, problem, and or solution? Is it fixable? How can you change the product or user experience?_
{% endhint %}
