# Chapter 5: Conducting Competitive Analysis

## Why do it?

* to convert a lot of information gathered into [competitive-research](chapter-4.md) phase into smaller actionable bites
* cherry-pick and recommend to the team the crucial features and opportunities that will create _**value innovation**_
* to identify which factors give other products their competitive advantage
* to find commonalities and differences so that you and your team can truly understand why certain products are more successful than others
* last but not least, to avoid emotionally fueled judgments

## 4 Steps to a Competitive Analysis and Market Opportunities

### Step 1: Scan, skim, and color-code each column for highs and lows

* Reacquaint with all rows \(competitors\) and columns \(attributes\) of [competitive-research](chapter-1-what-is-ux-strategy.md) spreadsheet \(CRS\) before analyzing them
* The color code should be used sparingly to highlight things that are crucial to remember, like green: strong attribute, yellow: weak attribute etc.
* Sample:

### Step 2: Creating logical groupings for comparison

* Goal is to make it easier to identify which factors give other products their competitive advantage by analyzing them in logical subgroups
* One subgroup which is a must: _direct and indirect competitors_
* Other subgroups example: 
  * Highest traffic or most downloads \(popular competitors at the top\) 
  * Newest to oldest in the market 
  * Numerous features to minimal features 
  * Largest to smallest in terms of SKUs, articles, or listings

### Step 3: Analyze each competitor by benchmarking product attributes and best practices

* Benchmarking is to identify and examine key facets of competitors identity so that comparisons can be made.
* For direct competitors:
  *  look for a baseline that defines the bottom-line criteria that future customers will expect when your team delivers on the value proposition.
  * any interesting feature that can be emulated
* For indirect competitors:
  * analyze how these digital products offer alternative ways to solve a problem. 

> At this point, we should see nuances among competitors. We have benchmarked attributes. We can gauge which competitors are a success or failure. We can say which competitor is number one, number two, and who’s doing something impressive even if they’re farther behind in the marketplace race than others. We have a sense of the diversity of business models in play.

#### Analysis column of CRS \(last column of CSR\)

Here these should be answered:

* How is it competing against your value proposition? 
  * If it’s a direct competitor, what is it doing great or particularly badly? 
  * If it’s an indirect competitor, is it competing with a similar solution or is it going after a similar customer segment? 
* What are the big takeaways the stakeholder should know if she only reads this cell?

### Step 4: Writing the Competitive Analysis Findings Brief

* First, you should be able to answer the following questions about the marketplace:
  *  Which competitors are closest to delivering a similar value proposition ? 
  * Are their products failing? Why? Or are their products succeeding so well that there’s no room for your product?
  *  Which competitors directly appeal to your customer segment? Of those competitors, how do you think customers discover them \(perhaps paid advertising\)? 
  * What products offer the best user experiences and business models? 
  * Who is doing something unique? 
  * What is working well for them? 
  * What do they have that your users like?
* Second, you need to address in the brief _**if there’s room in the market for your product**_.
  * What opportunities exist for it?
  *  What gaps could it fill? 
  * Perhaps your market research and analysis have shown you that your team has hit the entrepreneurial jackpot. 
    * Perhaps your product is one or all of the following: First-to-market with something unique \(such as Pinterest\) 
    * Offers users a better method to use or save time or finances \(Amazon Prime saves customers from having to waste time running errands.\) 
    * Creates value simultaneously for two different customer segments \(Airbnb does so for hosts and guests; Eventbrite for event planners and attendees.\) 
    * _This is a blue ocean._

{% hint style="info" %}
A blue ocean is full of customers with unmet needs. A red ocean is a market full of sharks fighting for the fish. In writing your brief, you must be able to say with certainty whether your product is in a blue, red, or somewhere-in-between purple ocean
{% endhint %}

#### Findings Brief format

* Section 1: Introduction/Goals
* Section 2: Direct Competitors
* Section 3: Indirect Competitors
* Section 4: Cool Features from Influencers
* Section 5: Taking a stand/Your Recommendations
  * Is this an expensive endeavor to take on or are there ways to de-risk the vision by experimenting with Minimum Viable Products \(MVPs\)?
  * Should the team pivot on the customer or its problem?
  * Does more research need to be conducted to really know if the value proposition is viable, such as with Guerrilla User Research or using landing page A/B tests?
