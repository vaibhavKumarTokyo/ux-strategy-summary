# Chapter 2: Four tenets of UX strategy ?

## UX strategy framework

> `UX Strategy = Business Strategy + Value Innovation + Validated User Research + Killer UX Design`

## UX strategy framework: Business Strategy

* The business strategy identifies the company’s guiding principles for how it will position itself and still achieve its objectives.
* For this to happen, the business must continually identify and utilize a competitive advantage.

### Business Strategy: competitive advantage

> two most common ways to achieve a competitive advantage: `cost leadership` and `differentiation`

### Business Strategy: conclusion

* building a business strategy `isn’t about formulating and executing a perfect plan`
* it’s about being able to research what’s out there, analyze the opportunities, run structured experiments, fail, learn, and iterate until we devise something of value that people truly want
* as the product scales and the market evolves, the business strategy must be nimble

## UX strategy framework: Value Innovation

Value Innovation = The simultaneous pursuit of `differentiation` and `low cost`” - Inspired by Blue Ocean Strategy

> `Blue ocean v/s Red ocean`

### UX strategy framework: Value Innovation

#### What is Innovation?

`Innovative means doing something that is new, original, and important enough to shake up a market`

### UX strategy framework: Value Innovation

> Sustainable Innovation v/s Disruptive Innovation

> * `Sustainable Innovation` any innovation that enables industry leaders to do something better for their existing customers
> * A `disruptive innovation` is a product that a company’s best customer potentially can’t use and therefore has substantially lower profit margins than the business might be willing to support

## UX strategy framework: Validated User Research

* Stakeholders are dreamers in that they assume what is valuable to their customers instead of verifying it.
* Validation is the process of confirming that a specific customer segment finds value in your product.

`The bottom line is that confronting your target customers is nonnegotiable. We must learn as quickly as possible if the idea we are working on is stupid and worthless.`

## UX strategy framework: Killer UX Design

> UX: User Experience, how users are feeling while interacting with your product/service It encompasses all touch-points, physical and digital It’s only when the UX is informed by and affects the other three tenets that mental models are broken. Disruption erupts!
