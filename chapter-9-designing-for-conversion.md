# Chapter 9: Designing for Conversion

## What is Conversion centric design aka Growth hacking?

* It is modern-day marketing using techniques such as
  * A/B tests, 
  * landing pages, 
  * viral factors, 
  * email deliverability, 
  * social media integration
  * collecting data on every touch points for various stages
* The goal of growth hacking is to tie viral and paid ad campaigns to user engagement metrics so that you can identify the most valuable marketing channels. 
* requires a cross functional team of 
  * designers, 
  * developers,
  * product managers, and
  * marketers

> Growth hacking entails continuous tinkering with the product’s sales funnel so that it is fully optimized for acquiring new users and getting them more deeply engaged.

### Horizontal axis

* **Suspect**
  * a user who might possibly require your product or service
* **Lead**
  * a potential sales contact, an individual, or an organization that expresses an interest in your product or services by providing you with some personal contact information
* **Prospect** 
  * anyone who has a need and strongly wants this need met through the purchase or consumption of your particular product
* **Customer**
  * a person or organization that is valuable to your business model. Customers either pay to use the product or they contribute something that is valuable to other users
* **Repeat User**
  * customers who “regularly” use your product or service
* **Reference**
  * somebody who refers others to the site based purely on her initial or continued experience

### Vertical axis

* **User's process**
  * describes the types of activities that users will be engaging in at each stage as they experience your product.
* **Desired Action**
  * what you hope users do in response to the “process” they just experienced
* **Business Task**
  * This is where you need to address what must happen behind the scenes to enable the user’s process
* **Metrics**
  * measurement for how well \(among other things\) your users have performed your desired action

* **Required Functionality**
  * actions, features and functionalities that needs to be integrated for that level of funnel. 
  * Example: twitter, fb integration
* **Validated Learning**
  * what percentage of users are visiting and reaching various stages of funnel
