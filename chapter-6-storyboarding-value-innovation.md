# Chapter 6: Storyboarding Value Innovation

## Why you do it?

* IF YOUR GOAL IS TO INVENT, YOU NEED TO LOOK FOR THE BENEFITS that will make your product indispensable to users.
* You must break out the UX moments that need to show incredible value before you move into a formal design phase.
* You need to mash up the principles of Tenet 2, Value Innovation, with Tenet 4, Killer UX.

## Techniques for Value Innovation Discovery

Your future customers need to want to choose your solution over any other because

1. it's significantly more efficient than what's currently out there,
2. it solves a pain point they didn't know they had, and/or
3. it creates an undeniable desire where none existed before.

The value innovation in your value proposition manifests itself as a unique feature set.

* The product offers a new mash-up of features from competitors and relevant UX influencers.
* The product provides an innovative "slice" or a twist to a value proposition from existing larger platforms.
* The product consolidates formerly disparate user experiences into one single simple and crucial solution. It becomes the one-stop shop for a user task.
* The product brings two separate and distinct user segments to be table to negotiate a deal that had not been possible before, thus revolutionizing those users' world.

## Four Poaching Techniques for Discovering New Opportunities for Value Innovation

1. Identify the key experiences
2. Take advantage of UX influencers
3. Do feature comparisons
4. Storyboard the value innovation

### IDENTIFY THE KEY EXPERIENCES

> A Minimum Viable Product \(MVP\) is just enough product to validate your key experiences \(value proposition\).

* The key experiences is the feature set that defines your value innovation.
* It must exist in order for your product to have a competitive advantage.
* It defines the experience that sets your product apart from all others.
* It might be an exotic permutation of features, or it can be a single significant features.

> Twitter is built around a single interaction: sending a 140-character message.

#### Questions that lead you to the key experiences

* What will make your provisional personas love this product?
* What moment or part of the user's journey makes this product unique?
* Based on your competitive research and analysis, what scenario or feature resolves a big shortfall?
* What kind of workarounds are your potential customers currently doing to accomplish their goals?

> The differentiation is what the key experience needs to express.

### TAKE ADVANTAGE OF UX INFLUENCERS

> UX influencers are any cool or relevant UX features or findings about the marketplace that might not come from competitors. They are not in your product's competitive landscape but could offer insight into your product's value innovation.

* Mixing and matching disparate feature sets is one of value innovation patterns.
* You'll catch clues by looking at all the details and figuring out how to use them for you product.
* Ideally, you will improve on the concepts, taking them up a notch on the design ladder for your product.

### DO FEATURE COMPARISONS

* Research and identify multiple \(three to five\) instances of a similar user feature and put all those references into once document. This way, you can compare different approaches to a single UX problem.
* A feature comparison can be very helpful to identify opportunities for value innovation. It takes all the puzzle pieces out of the box and puts them onto the table in plain sight.
* Then, you pick out the best pieces and components to build a new interaction pattern.
* You do whatever is necessary to poach elements and them stich them together a superior UX.

#### Benefits of feature comparisons

* You can observe and quantify best practices and lame practices and interesting approaches the competitors are creating for users to accomplish tasks with formal or newfangled design patterns.
* You can save endless design hours. You don't have to design the new project from scratch, because you don't to reinvent the wheel.
* You can see the common user flows through the apps so that you can quickly make an application or site map.
* You can recognize the patterns and common ways for helping users accomplish their goals.
* You can avoid creating something totally new and make the UI more complicated.
* You can deal with insane stakeholders or a HIPPO.
